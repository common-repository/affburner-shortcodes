Affburner shortcodes for WordPress. Pay per sale alternative for Google Adsense.

== Description ==

Affburner shortcodes for WordPress makes it super easy to add Affburner advertisements to your posts, pages and text-widgets. 

http://Affburner.com is an advertising platform that allows website owners to convert website-traffic into revenue. After signing up on our website and logging in, you will receive a SID (site id) which you can use configure ads on your website. With the help from this plugin or with a custom javascript tracking code (similar to Google Adsense) you can start advertising within minutes. Affburner carefully selects the advertisements that are displayed on your website. Earnings
are made through a commission structure in which an advertiser pays it's publisher a percentage of each sale transaction that is made (pay per sale), this differs from AdSense which uses a PPC (pay per click) model.
